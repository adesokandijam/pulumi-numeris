# Disaster Recovery Plan for Pulumi Infrastructure

## 1. Objectives
The primary objective of the disaster recovery plan is to ensure that infrastructure managed by **Pulumi** can be restored to its desired state in the event of:
- **Unplanned outages** (e.g., system crashes, network issues)
- **Data corruption** (e.g., database failures)
- **Accidental changes** (e.g., human error in configuration)
- **Security breaches** (e.g., data leaks, compromised credentials)

## 2. Key Resources for Disaster Recovery
The following resources are critical to restoring your Pulumi-managed infrastructure:
- **Pulumi Configuration & Secrets**: Store configuration settings, sensitive information, and environment variables (e.g., database passwords) securely.
- **Infrastructure Code**: Ensure all your Pulumi infrastructure code (e.g., `__main__.py`) is versioned and stored in a **GitHub repository**.
- **State Files**: Pulumi uses state files to track infrastructure changes. These need to be backed up and managed.
- **Cloud Provider Credentials**: Ensure AWS, GCP, or other cloud provider credentials are available and stored securely in GitHub Secrets or a vault.

## 3. Recovery Scenarios
Below are the scenarios for which you need to plan for recovery:

### 3.1. Pulumi State Loss
- **Problem**: If the Pulumi state file is lost or corrupted, you cannot track the infrastructure resources, leading to possible outages and mismanagement.
- **Solution**: 
  - **Backup State Files**: Regularly back up your Pulumi state file. Use the `--backend-url` option to configure a secure cloud storage backend (e.g., AWS S3).
  - **Restore State**: In case of loss, use the backed-up state file or retrieve it from the cloud storage (e.g., S3 bucket).
  - **Example Command**:
    ```bash
    pulumi login s3://your-bucket-name
    ```
    You can also restore the stack using the same Pulumi backend.

### 3.2. Codebase Loss or Corruption
- **Problem**: If the infrastructure code or configuration files are lost, the infrastructure may need to be recreated.
- **Solution**: 
  - **Version Control**: Ensure the Pulumi code is committed to a GitHub repository with **version control**.
  - **Restore from GitHub**: If the code is lost, clone or checkout the last known good state from the repository.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate the deployment with GitHub Actions, so the infrastructure can be redeployed from the codebase.
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourorg/pulumi-numeris.git
  cd pulumi-numeris
  pulumi up
  ```

### 3.3. Cloud Provider Credential Issues
- **Problem**: If cloud credentials are compromised or lost, your Pulumi infrastructure cannot be managed.
- **Solution**: 
  - **Rotate Credentials**: Use AWS IAM roles or GCP service accounts and rotate credentials periodically.
  - **Use GitHub Secrets**: Store cloud provider API keys and sensitive configurations securely in **GitHub Secrets**.
  - **Configure New Credentials**: If you cannot access the credentials, configure new access keys for AWS or GCP and update the secrets in your GitHub repository.
  
  For AWS, use:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```

### 3.4. Accidental Deletion of Resources
- **Problem**: If infrastructure resources are accidentally deleted by a user, they need to be restored.
- **Solution**:
  - **Pulumi Stack State**: Use the `pulumi stack` commands to check the status of the stack and recover deleted resources if the state is intact.
  - **Backup Resources**: Use cloud-native snapshots or backups for critical resources (e.g., RDS, EC2, etc.). For RDS databases, enable **automated backups**.
  - **Pulumi Restore**: If the stack is corrupted or has missing resources, you can manually restore the infrastructure using Pulumi's configuration and code.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulumi up --refresh
  ```

### 3.5. Security Breach or Malicious Changes
- **Problem**: If infrastructure code or cloud resources are compromised by an attacker.
- **Solution**:
  - **Version Control History**: Use version history to roll back malicious or unintended changes.
  - **Audit Logs**: Implement audit logging in cloud services to track unauthorized access or changes.
  - **Change Management**: Enforce policies to require approval or code review before deploying changes.
  - **Rebuild Infrastructure**: If necessary, you can destroy the compromised infrastructure and redeploy using your latest version of Pulumi code.

## 4. Backup and Restore Strategy
Ensure that the following resources are backed up and can be restored quickly:
- **Pulumi State Files**: Configure Pulumi to store state files in a **cloud storage backend** like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or a managed Pulumi backend.
  
  Example for AWS S3:
  ```bash
  pulumi login s3://your-bucket-name
  ```

- **Codebase**: Ensure that all Pulumi code (infrastructure code, configuration files, etc.) is backed up to **GitHub** or another version-controlled repository.
  
- **Cloud Resources**: 
  - **AWS**: Set up **automatic snapshots** for critical resources such as RDS, EC2, and EBS.
  - **Database Backups**: Ensure **automatic backups** are enabled for databases like RDS and MongoDB.
  
  Example for enabling AWS RDS automated backups:
  ```bash
  aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance> --backup-retention-period 7
  ```

### 4.1. **Automated Backup of RDS**
To make disaster recovery easier, **automated backups** are enabled for the RDS instance. This ensures that database snapshots are taken regularly without requiring manual intervention. In the event of a failure or corruption, you can restore the RDS instance to any available snapshot.

### 4.2. **Multi-Region Backup with S3**
To further enhance disaster recovery, **RDS snapshots** are transferred to an **S3 bucket**. This ensures that snapshots are safely stored in a different region, providing resilience in case of a regional failure. The snapshots in S3 are accessible for quick restoration of the database across regions.

Additionally, we will set up **deletion protection** on the S3 bucket to avoid accidental deletion of critical backup data. **Deletion alerts** will be configured to notify the team if any deletion requests are made, ensuring that the backup data is always protected.

**S3 Bucket Deletion Protection**:
- Enable **S3 Object Locking** to ensure that backups are immutable and cannot be deleted.
- Set up **SCPs (Service Control Policies)** to restrict deletion of S3 buckets or objects containing backup data.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket your-backup-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

### 4.3. **Deactivation Alerts**
To ensure no backup data is lost, **deletion alerts** will be set up on the S3 bucket. If any object is deleted from the backup bucket, an alert will notify the team for quick action. Additionally, we will configure **SCPs** to enforce policies that prevent the accidental deletion of backup data, ensuring that only authorized users can make changes to critical resources.

## 5. Testing the Disaster Recovery Plan
It is essential to periodically test your disaster recovery strategy to ensure it will work when required.

- **Recovery Drills**: Run drills where you simulate a failure (e.g., deletion of Pulumi state, cloud credential loss) and recover it based on your DR plan.
- **Monitor Success**: Track the time taken for recovery and ensure the restoration process is seamless.

## 6. Continuous Improvement
Regularly update and refine the disaster recovery plan based on lessons learned and improvements in your Pulumi infrastructure and workflows:
- **Audit Logs**: Review security logs to check for unauthorized changes.
- **Backup Strategies**: Continuously review your backup strategies for effectiveness and implement new solutions (e.g., multi-region backups).

## 7. Communication During Disasters
In case of a disaster, itâ€™s crucial to communicate promptly:
- **Notify** the relevant teams (e.g., DevOps, security, cloud engineers).
- **Provide Updates** via a dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack, email).

## 8. Conclusion
Having a **Disaster Recovery** plan ensures that you can recover quickly from unexpected outages, configuration issues, or malicious activity, minimizing downtime and loss of critical infrastructure managed by Pulumi.

By regularly testing, automating recovery workflows, and securely managing secrets and backups, you can ensure your infrastructure remains resilient and protected.
