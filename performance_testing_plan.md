# Performance Testing Plan

## Overview
This document describes the strategy for evaluating system performance under load.

## Tools
- **Load Testing**: Apache JMeter, k6.
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray.

## Test Types
1. **Load Testing**
   - Measure response times under normal workloads.

2. **Stress Testing**
   - Identify system breaking points with increased loads.

3. **Endurance Testing**
   - Validate system stability during prolonged usage.

4. **Scalability Testing**
   - Evaluate performance when scaling resources.

## Execution Plan
1. Set up a staging environment replicating production.
2. Simulate traffic using k6 scripts.
3. Monitor ECS task utilization and RDS query performance.
4. Analyze results and optimize system configurations.

## Reporting
- Share performance results and improvement suggestions with stakeholders.
